FightBall

This app was created in hopes of a multi-user, where users can select a player type. 
  The original though process was to have 3 different types of player-characters:
    1. Basketball player - the average player, has an average speed / damage rating
    2. Tennis player - the fast player, is about 2x the speed of basketball player, but does 1/2x the damage
    3. Golfer - slow player, does 2x the damage of a basketball player, but takes 2x the time to shoot


However, due to some blunders, I took a different direction with this project.
Originally, I wanted to use MEANstack with websockets functionality, but I realized that Angular was unnecessary to my 
app. Therefore, I switched gears and decided to use Express, Node, and websockets to setup an application.

Moving forward from that, I decided to add in a type-racer component, where users can compete in their typing speeds
and see who has the highest words per minute.
